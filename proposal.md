# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Snack assistant for diabetics

TODO

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

It will be a program that allows me to input my blood sugar, and based on that give me recommended snack choices.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My program will collect what my blood sugar is, and then retrieve what time of day it is. From that I will have recommended snacks based on carbs, and what time of day it is(breakfast, lunch, dinner). I will have lists of my favorite snacks that I always have, and some that i less commonly have, but would be treats. It will also factor in the amount of exercise I plan to do that day. I plan on monitoring what happens to my blood sugar after I exercise, and i already have a pretty good idea of what does happen. But if there is an instance where my blood sugar is high it will not run through to give me a snack, but it will return the amount of fast acting insulin I need to give to myself. All of this will be done through dictionaries, and reading different excel files i create for this. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I would be happy if I could get the program to pull in the right time and then based on that and my blood sugar give me a snack.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Building off of the last one. If I was able to have the foods organized into sub categories, so the program could ask what food i was interested in example(junk food, veges, candy, etc)

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome for me would be having the project be able to take in all of my various requirements, so that i get an accurate number of carbs that I should be allowed to eat. Additionally, i would like it to be able to give me the necessary units of insulin to take given different blood sugars. Finally, I want it to store my blood sugar level with date and time so I have a record instead of writing them down like i do. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I definitely need to improve my understanding of lists, and dictionaries because those are going to be used heavily throughout this project. I also think having the code run differently based on what time of day it is will be a challenge. Id prefer to figure out a way to almost add a running clock, so it wasnâ€™t just an input. I think ultimately having all of the information as to the different types of food I'm looking for will be the most time consuming of this project. I think that none of the tools I need are particularly hard, but this tool will make my life a lot easier when it comes to decision making. Especially with this being such a new thing for me.
