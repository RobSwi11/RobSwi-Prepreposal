# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?


#1 A car game, kind of like temple run, where you dodge the other cars.

#2 A "pokedex", but for different rare sports cars you've seen.

#3 A code that will tell me how many carbs I'm allowed to eat based on how active I was that day, my target blood sugar, and preferred type of food. 


## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

none

## Do you have any questions of your own?

If I end up doing #3, I'm going to be doing most of the testing for how different snacks affect my sugars. How many different snacks should i account for?

For #2 how many cars should I add to it?

For #1 is there anyway that I would be able to make it first person but still 2D?
